# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

Verify command example
```shell
npx hardhat verify --network bscTestnet 0x1B3eb089cB7aAEE3c119091ce291590F464Eb6a5 "ION Stablecoin" "ION" $UNDERLYING_TOKEN_ADDRESS 0 100000000
```
